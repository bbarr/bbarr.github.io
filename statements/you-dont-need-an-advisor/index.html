          <p>The financial services industry wants you to believe investing is complicated and that most people need an expert to navigate markets, pick stocks, and manage your money.</p>
          <p><strong>This is false.</strong></p>
          <p>For the vast majority of people, a simple portfolio of low-cost index funds, held consistently over time, will outperform actively managed portfolios.</p>
          <p>You have a few choices, listed below from simplest (most expensive) to most involved (least expensive).</p>

            <h2>1. Use a Roboadvisor</h2>
            <p>
              Roboadvisors are digital services that help you set up and manage your portfolio at very low cost. Companies like Wealthfront, Betterment, or Vanguard act as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp" target="_blank">fiduciaries</a> and offer solid services here and you won't have to deal with
              high-fees, hidden costs, or advisor conflicts of interest. Okay, fine, roboadvisors are still investment advisors, but they are best-of-breed.

            <blockquote>
              <strong>Think advisors always act in your interest?</strong> Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, UBS, Raymond James, Edward Jones, Ameriprise, Osaic, just to name a few companies where advisors can suggest "suitable" options for you, rather than "best", which a fiduciary is legally required to offer.

            <h2>2. Target Date Fund and Chill</h2>
            <p>
              A target date fund (TDF) is internally managed to maintain a reasonable risk to reward balance as it relates to a specific date in the future. If you wanted to retire in 2050, you could invest in a 2050 TDF and it should give you a strong chance of maximizing your money with decreasing volatility by that date. Remember to look for low-fees. And then stop looking. Just let time, compounding, and internal fund mechanics do the work.

            <h2>3. Invest consistently in a reasonable portfolio.</h2>
            <p>
              You don't need to chase performance, or worse, chase after out-performance. Grab a reasonable portfolio (Eg. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio">Boglehead's Three-Fund</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/60-40-portfolio/">the 60/40</a>) and stick with it. Yes, you might have to learn some finance basics but it isn't terribly complicated and you may even enjoy
              understanding something so important for your future self. This option is especially sensitive to self-sabatage so remember that the "stick with it" part is more important than the "which portfolio" part.

            <p>That's it. No more paying 1% or higher for the benefit of poorly incentivized advice and recurring underperformance.</p>
