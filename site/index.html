          Hi, my name is <strong>Brendan Barr</strong>. I am a web developer obsessed with building clean, user-focused experiences. 
          For over 12 years I have worked at agencies, startups, and on several of my own products. 
          I have also been exclusively remote since 2015.

              Built an eLearning platform to help replace the Flash-based legacy version. Helped redefine the level of abstraction for course content for easier consumption across clients.

            <div class="text-gray-700">
              Built an infinitely-loading listicle component that handled memory and DOM size limitations while allowing non-janky scrolling in both directions.

            <div class="text-gray-700">
              This was an unexpected gig that came out of a freelancing request to build a better video app for the mobile web.
              Hand-rolled an advanced video player in vanilla JS, without access to Media Source Extensions due to mobile browser incompatibilities. Link is not clickable due to the project being on pause, and the NSFW nature of it.

            <div class="text-gray-700">
              Medium is my confusingly named communicating sequential processes (CSP) library that provides what I believe
              is the simplest implementation possible for Javascript with a reasonable feature set. Use channels to
              coordinate between various async workflows.
