Some things are most important when they are absent or in short supply &mdash; it exhibits diminshing returns. Wealth is an obvious example of this, 
as is physical fitness. When I find myself working towards progress that has an extreme (or no) theoretical upper limit, I try to ask if there is a practical one instead. 

As an example, sometime back I decided that while I love lifting weights, I don't have any real interest in achieving my body's maximum potential strength. 
I just want to be and look capable and strong.  That's it. And indeed, if I went to push myself to extremes I would be inviting injury, burnout, 
reduced availability in my social calendar, and then even if all goes well, a body that doesn't even look as impressive as it should. 
This meant I had to decide on what "enough" was for me in the context of fitness. I have some lifting goals that put me well above the average Joe and when they are reached, 
I focus on maintaining them and working on other exercises or aspects of fitness.

Money is another common subject that is generally treated from a blindly maximalist point of view. I regularly project future cashflows to try and keep an accurate 
sense of "enough money". This dictates how I invest, how I earn, and also what I choose to spend now and in the future. This has an added benefit of helping me sleep
at night because my future finances are not completely shrouded in mystery; just partly shrouded by the reality that the best projections still kind of suck. But it 
is something and I like how it keeps my over my feet rather than skis.

I could write more on this particular topic, like how societal pressures push us towards unhealthy extremes, but I think I have written enough about this idea already, don't you?
